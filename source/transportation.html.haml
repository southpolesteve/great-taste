%h3 Transportation to the Festival
%p
  The MHTG has always had the safety or our patrons first and foremost in our minds. As such, we provide several free or inexpensive ways to get home safely, and we also encourage our patrons to make use of Madison Metro Transit buses. We ask for your cooperation in making the Great Taste a non-driving event. Have a friend drop you off and take a bus, a one-dollar taxi, or a free shuttle home.
