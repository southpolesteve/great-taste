    <h3>Rails is for Beginners</h3>
    <p>This morning I came across an article on hacker news titled <a href="http://www.horsesaysinternet.com/code/rails-is-not-for-beginners/">Rails Is Not For Beginners</a>. The article is actually about Sinatra, but the link-bait title is dead wrong. Rails is perfect for beginners and here is why &hellip;</p>

<p>A friend of mine with zero programming experience recently asked me to help him learn web development. We setup rails together, and I pointed him to some online tutorials. When he called me the next evening, he could barely contain his excitement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Rails is awesome! I can edit, add, delete! This is a real web app and I made it!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Rails, with only a few commands you can have a fully functioning CRUD app built on scaffolding. No experienced Rails developer I know uses scaffolding. So why is it still in the source code? Because Rails is for beginners.</p>

<p>The best way to teach anyone web development is to inspire them to learn on their own. My friend is a long way from being a productive web developer, but because of Rails he is <strong>excited</strong> to learn more.</p>

<p>If you are a beginner and looking for a place to start, I recommend <a href="http://zfer.us/zvmvl">railstutorial.org</a>. It is a fantastic resource, and best of all the online version is free.</p>
