    <h3>Tour de Madison B-cycle</h3>
    <p>In Madison, we are fortunate to have a nice bicycle sharing system called <a href="http://madison.bcycle.com/home.aspx">Madison B-cycle</a>. B-cycle is perfect for short trips and the occasional commute. Being located all over the city, I used B-cycles frequently last summer. In this month&rsquo;s newsletter to members, the Madison B-cycle staffed proposed a challenge -  bike all 32 stations in 24 hours. The prize? A Madison B-Cycle t-shirt. How could I say no?</p>

<p>I recruited my buddy Will to go with me and we planned our trip for a breezy 40 degree day. I even used the B-Cycle API to write a program that would optimize our route (look for another post on this later). We split the trip into 3 stages. Stage 1 started at 7AM on the corner of W. Washington and Regent and took us to 17 stations west of the capitol. Stage 2 was a quick loop of the capitol stations, which we completed over lunch. After work, we completed the final stage taking us to all the east side stations. Total time and distance: roughly 3 hours 30 minutes and just over 20 miles.</p>

<p>Overall, the experience was quite awesome and fun!. Tour de Bcycle gave us the opportunity to see Madison in an entirely new way. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested. A 24-hour pass is only $5, so you don&rsquo;t even need to be an annual member.</p>

<p>The GPS I had with me was acting up, but you can see our <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/southpolesteve/activity/131576726">incomplete route on runkeeper</a>. I also brought my DSLR along and put together a short video documenting the trip:</p>
